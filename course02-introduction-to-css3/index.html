            <p id="item1">Infantry troops and heroes specialize in close combat, offering high defense and durability. These front-line fighters are perfect for withstanding heavy attacks and are especially effective against Lancer troops and heroes. Their high survivability makes them ideal for prolonged battles.</p>
            <p id="item2">Lancer troops and heroes are versatile mid-range fighters with balanced durability and attack power. They serve as reliable all-rounders and excel in battles against Marksman troops and heroes, giving them a strategic advantage in mixed-unit combat scenarios.</p>
            <p id="item3">Marksman troops and heroes excel in long-range combat, boasting the highest attack power among all troop types. Their ability to deal massive damage makes them lethal against Infantry troops and heroes. However, their low durability and vitality require careful planning and support to keep them safe in battle.</p>
